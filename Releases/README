These are the release versions of the Bricktronics Shield and Bricktronics Megashield libraries for Arduino. Because Arduino is a frustratingly-unflexible piece of software, and won't work correctly if the ZIP archive is not named the same as the library, we have extra copies of the libraries without the date in the filename. The latest version of each library has the most-recent date, and another copy is available without the date, which should work with Arduino's "Add Library" button from the menu system.
